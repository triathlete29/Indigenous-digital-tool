    <h3 style="color: white;" style="display: center;">Title of Study: Designing a Digital Video Teaching Tool from an Indigenous Lens.</h3>
    <h3 style="color: white;" style="display: center;">Principal Researcher and Co-Investigators: Dr. Rose Cameron, Dr. Simon Xu and Furkan Zengin</h3>
    <h3 style="color: white;" style="display: center;">Greetings</h3>
    <p style="color: white;">
      I am thankful that I am being greeted in the spirit of the seven grandfather teachings that Dr. Rose Cameron, Dr. Simon Xu and Furkan Zengin are collaborating on. I also acknowledge the sacred lands of the Anishinaabeg at Bawating, specifically the Anishinaabeg from both the Garden River, and Batchewana First Nations, and Métis people who live in the community. 
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: white;" style="display: center;">Study Details</h3>
    <p style="color: white;">It’s been shared with me that the purpose of this exploratory study is to continue supporting and promoting excellence in Indigenous teaching and learning at Algoma University. I am being asked to share my ideas and insights into what features would be useful in designing an innovative Indigenous-based teaching tool that can be used by an instructor in the virtual classroom context. My participation as an Algoma University student in this study will help to modify, develop, or otherwise expand virtual teaching products and services. The researchers are offering compensation in the amount of $5.00 for <u>completing</u> the online survey.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: white;" style="display: center;">Data We Will Collect</h3>
    <p style="color: white;">
      Data will be collected from fifty (25) undergraduate students from Algoma University and the researchers are using an online survey for convenience. Each online survey will take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete. I will take my time to provide detailed responses. The questions include demographic information: Year of study, program of study, and age. The questions are categorized and includes: Introductory Questions, Use of Educational Applications, and/or Websites, Use of Current Features, Discovering and Fostering New Educational Experiences, Understanding and Fostering New Ideas and Opportunities, and Final Questions.  
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: white;" style="display: center;">How We Will Use Your Data</h3>
    <p style="color: white;">
      Any data or personal information collected from me will be strictly confidential. The data will not be shared with anyone other than with Dr. Cameron, Dr. Xu and Furkan Zengin. The data will not be connected to your identity and it will remain anonymous. 
    </p>
    <p style="color: white">
      All data collected will be kept in a confidential file in a password protected laptop. All hard data will also be kept in Dr. Cameron’s file cabinet and her office will be locked at all times after hours. Once data is collected it will be analyzed together and is to be reconstructed into dominant themes using the grounded theory method. The aggregate results will be used to re-conceptualize the re-imagined features of an Indigenous teaching tool. 
    </p>
    <p style="color: white">
      The data has no identifying information connected to me and it may be presented at Research forums, Social Work, and Computer Conferences, and may be published in relevant journals.
    </p>
    <p style="color: white">
      The research findings will be shared with me on/or about May 26, 2023. If interested, I will be emailed a google link to the virtual presentation closer to the date. I am fine for the researcher to use my email address and I have been informed that my email address will be kept confidential
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: white;" style="display: center;">My Rights</h3>
    <p style="color: white;">
      I know that my participation in this study is voluntary. I can discontinue my participation at any time without giving a reason prior to the analysis stage. I realize that once the data is in the analysis phase, and knowing that my data is anonymous, I am fine that my collected data will continue to be analyzed. If I have any questions I will email fzengin@algomau.ca right away.
    </p>
    <p style="color: white">
      I understand that if I have any other questions about the research project to contact the Research Ethics Board, ethics@algomau.ca
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: white">
      Potential Risks and Benefits
    </h3>
    <p style="color: white;">
      I have been made aware that the questions in the online survey are broad and the probability of harm impacted on me by answering the questions are no greater than those encountered by participants who are exposed to digital teaching technology platforms within the classroom context. The research is considered ‘minimal risk’. Nevertheless, should I as a participant experience some type of negative psychological impacts after responding to the questions, I fully understand that I am responsible to contact my Academic Success Advisor for support.
    </p>
    <p style="color: white">
      The benefits of participating in the study gives me an opportunity to share my experience of what (virtual) features may be the best for learning. I am able to  participate and contribute my ideas/concepts to such an innovative research project. I am aware that my ideas will assist the researchers to design an Indigenous-based Teaching Tool in the future. I have been made aware that if I have any questions about the research project that I should not hesitate to contact Furkan Zengin, who will contact the primary researchers, Dr. Cameron and Dr. Xu.     
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: white">
      Feedback to The Participants
    </h3>
    <p style="color: white;">
      The results of the study will be shared with me on Friday, May 26, 2023 at 1 pm. If I am interested in attending the presentation, a google link closer to the date will be sent to me.
      I understand the information provided to me regarding the “Designing a Digital Video Teaching Tool from an Indigenous Lens” as described herein.
      My questions about the research project have been answered to my satisfaction from the content in this consent form. I, therefore, will visit the “Take the Survey” button to indicate my agreement to participate in the study. I will make a copy of this Informed Consent of Participants Form for myself to keep.
